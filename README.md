Master Thesis Unsupervised Image Clustering

Goal of this thesis is to develop a program that clusters a large
set of images by using NVIDIA graphic cards for computing. The
program is roughly divided into three parts (excluding test setup):

* Feature Selection (SIFT detector)
* Feature Compression (Autoencoder)
* Feature Clustering (Bag of Visual Words)
